In the rapidly evolving fields of data science and machine learning, researchers face a significant challenge: data deluge, with about 200 research papers being published daily. Navigating this vast sea of information to stay updated, identify research gaps, and avoid duplicated efforts becomes increasingly daunting. Traditional literature review methods are becoming less feasible, consuming valuable time and effort. We use the arXiv data set with its corpus of 10000+ research papers to tackle this issue on a smaller scale before increasing scalability. So far, there have been more generic text summarization models for summarizing research articles, but we plan to include other aspects (trend analysis and research gap identification) and tackle this niche case study. In such a landscape, a tool like Litrify, designed for automated trend analysis and gap identification, becomes crucial. It offers a streamlined approach to literature review, enhancing research efficiency and fostering a more interconnected scholarly community.

To address this issue of growing importance, we create a framework for an automated research helper with the 3 functionalities mentioned above: text summarization, trend analysis and research gap or niche trends identification. We will start by going over the data set used, how it was extracted, and the features. Following this, we will cover the low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk goals and how we accomplished them, the measures of success and how we quantified the approach that is majorly subjective. We did some preliminary literature surveys to contextualize standard procedures for text summarization, trend analysis and gap identification in other and related contexts to look for ways to substantiate our efforts. Finally, we integrate the three aspects of the framework and try additional ways of representing these independent pieces of interconnected extracts.
